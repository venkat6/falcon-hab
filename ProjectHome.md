FALCON stands for Flight And Logistics CONsole.  It is developed by the HABET team at the Space Systems and Controls Lab at Iowa State University for their High Altitude Balloon flights.  FALCON is able to read in APRS strings from a AGWPE server, parse them and display the information in an easy to use format.  It can display the location using a 2-D Google Map or export to a Google Earth KML file for 3-D tracking.  FALCON also has a flight prediction algorithm that continuously updates the predicted landing based on the ascent profile of the balloon.
